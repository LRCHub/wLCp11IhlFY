When you grow up
They tell you there's responsibilities
But all you wanna do is
Make love and make time and make money
For the things in life
You spend to make a better world
You think you're so free
And you're so fucking groovy

(So get up and find out how things could be)
I'm not talking from experience
But me you must believe
(So wake up and make up your mind to be free)
Yeah, here's that woman on the TV

You can take it if you want it
It's not easy to resist
It's the same conclusion I'm coming to
You know life is worth living
If you're willing to, yeah

How long can a bad thing last?
This is what people should ask
If you're feeling down, put your vote to cast
How long, been going on for too long

A woman I know makes a living out of this
And the sad thing is
Is that the victims don't resist
You can take it or leave it
Or fake it or put it down
But believe me, it's a bad day buster
When your not around

(So get up and find out how things could be)
Are you making fun of me?
Are you making fun of me?
(So wake up and make up your mind to be free)
Yeah, here's that woman on that TV

How long can a bad thing last?
This is what people should ask
If you're feeling down, put your vote to cast
How long, this is going on for too long

This is not the chance for anybody
You know life is worth living
If you're willing to

You can take it if you want it
It's not easy to resist
It's the same conclusion I'm coming to
You know life is worth living
If you're willing to, yeah

How long
(So get up, so get up and go)
This is what
(You gotta, you gotta make her stand down)
If you're feeling down, put your vote to cast
I said, how long can a bad thing last?

I said, how long can this go
You gotta, you gotta, you gotta stand down
(Why don't you tell me)
