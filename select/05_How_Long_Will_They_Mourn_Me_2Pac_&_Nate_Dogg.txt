How long will they mourn me?
Yeah! This for my nigga Kato
It's still on, nigga
We even got the thug life, thugs for life
Ha ha, how long will they mourn me?
Yeah nigga
2Pac in this muthafucka

All my homies drinking liquor
Tears in everybody's eyes
Niggas cried to mourn a homies homicide
But I can't cry, instead I'm just a shoulder
Damn, why they take another soldier
I load my clip before my eyes blurry, don't worry
I'll get them suckas back before your buried, shit
Retaliate and pull a 187
Do real niggas get to go to Heaven?

How long will they mourn me, bury me a muthafuckin' G
Bitch don't wanna die, then don't fuck with me
It's kinda hard to be optimistic
When your homies lying dead on the pavement twisted
Y'all don't hear me doe, I'm trying hard to make amends
But I'm losing all my muthafuckin' friends, damn
They should've shot me when I was born
Now I'm trapped in the muthafuckin' storm

How long will they mourn me?
I wish it would have been another
How long will they mourn me?
How long will they mourn my brother?
(Got them niggas all dead and shit)
How long will they mourn me?
(Incomprehensible)
I wish it would have been another
(Nate Dogg)
How long will they mourn me?
(Gotta keep this shit goin' on)
How long will they mourn my brother?
(Yo Syke)

How long will they mourn me? Every muthafuckin' day homie
You stayed down when tha other niggas didn't know me
From my heart to the trigga, you my fuckin' nigga
And things won't be the same without you nigga
I remember kickin' back, you wanted to lack
And goin' half on a muthafuckin' hundred sack
Smokin' blunt after blunt and steady drinkin'
Hung around so much, you knew what I was thinkin'

Tell me Lord, why You take Big Kato?
So confused not knowing which way to go
I'm goin' crazy and runnin' out of fuckin' time
I can't take it, I'm losin' my fuckin' mind
So day after day, ride after ride
We'll hook up on the other side
Watch over your family and your newborn

Till we meet again homie

How long will they mourn me?
I wish it would have been another
(Yo Kato)
How long will they mourn me?
How long will they mourn my brother?
(It's still on nigga)
How long will they mourn me?
I wish it would have been another
(Yeah)
How long will they mourn me?
How long will they mourn my brother?
(Rated R, Double Jeopardy, Mack 10)

Damn a nigga tired of feeling sad
I'm tired of putting in work
I'm tired of cryin' while watching my homies leave the earth
I know soon one day I'll be in the dirt
And my peoples'll be mournin'
When they get a call from the coroner

All niggas can say is that's fucked up
And get tossed up, reminiscing how we grew up
(My nigga)
Rest and love to my nigga Kato
See you in the crossroads real soon
For now let me pour out some brew
I'll be always thinkin' of ya homie
Rest in peace, how long will they mourn me?

Ya know life's a fuckin' trip
And everybody gotta go
But why the fuck it have to be my nigga Kato
Another nigga fell victim to the chrome
It's enough to make you crazy
It's fuckin' with my dome

Ya only live once on this earth
A nigga had it bad, since the day
Of my motherfuckin' birth
But niggas say they down
And they always be my homie
But when a nigga gone

How long will you mourn me? Yeah
I wish it would have been another
(Mack 10 in this muthafucka)
Yeah, how long will you mourn me?
How long will they mourn my brother?
(Thug Life boy, Nate blowin' that shit)
I wish it would have been another
(Nate Dogg do that shit nigga)
Yeah, how long will you mourn me?
How long will they mourn my brother?
(This for my nigga Kato and all his kids)
How long will you mourn me?
I wish it would have been another
